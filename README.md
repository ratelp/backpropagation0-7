This project utilizes backpropagation to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognize numbers from 0 to 7 and transform them into their 3-bit binary format (000 to 111).

The network architecture consists of one input layer, one hidden layer (with 7 neurons), and three output neurons, each representing a position in the binary number.

Each output neuron in the ANN returns a value between -1 and 1. A value of 0.9 or greater is interpreted as 1, while other values are considered 0
